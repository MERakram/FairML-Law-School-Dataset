# Critical Assessment of Fairness Mitigation Techniques

## Dataset Characteristics and Inherent Biases

- The Law School dataset shows a significant **disparate impact** of 0.8116 for the baseline model.
- Statistical parity difference of -0.1857 indicates that White students have a higher probability of passing the bar exam.
- Equal opportunity difference of -0.1017 suggests disparities in true positive rates across racial groups.

## Effectiveness of Mitigation Techniques

### Pre-processing Techniques

- **Reweighing**: Improved fairness metrics while maintaining accuracy
- **Disparate Impact Remover**: Successfully reduced disparate impact

### Post-processing Techniques

- **Calibrated Equalized Odds**: Limited effectiveness in balancing error rates

### Alternative Models

- **Random Forest**: Did not substantially improve the fairness-accuracy trade-off

## Key Trade-offs and Findings

1. **Accuracy vs. Fairness Trade-off**: Some fairness interventions resulted in accuracy reductions.
2. **Best Overall Approach**: **Reweighing** provided the best fairness improvements, while **Baseline** maintained the highest accuracy.

## Conclusion

While algorithmic fairness interventions demonstrated meaningful improvements in bias metrics, achieving true fairness in predicting law school outcomes requires a holistic approach that combines technical solutions with institutional and societal change.
